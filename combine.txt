The R S X processor is connected to the motherboard via a ball grid array, also known as B G A. |
When the processor heats up and expands, it introduces thermal stress to the ball grid array. |
Led free soldering is more fragile than the traditional one, and therefore cracks easily form over time. |
This causes the connection issue between the R S X processor and the motherboard |
When you heat up the processor with a high enough temperature, you melth the solder joints which restores the connection temporarily. |
But the connection is not a solid one. Sooner or later, it will break again. |
If the problem is in the B G A, you can solve it by reballing the R S X processor. |
But if the problem is in the underfill, there is not much you can do.
